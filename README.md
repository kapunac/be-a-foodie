Project name : Food Recipes with React

Description: A cool website with chef recipes, great website
to spice things up in the kitchen. I'm using MealDB to fetch 
recipes and display them on the home page, there is a search 
input at the top to search recipes by name. Clicking on a recipe
will send an id to URL and the Component FullMeal will read that id
and display information on that desired recipe.

Today's project is Recipe Website App.
This project is build using ReactJS framework

***************************************

I'm learning ReactJS for some time now I have
chosen to build a Recipe App using API.
Special thanks to MealDB (https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)
for this API!

***************************************

While I was coding this project I stumbled upon
many challenges, but since it is simple project
I had no special problems worth mentioning, API
works great and I never had problems fetching it.
I only wish I had more information on recipes to show.
The biggest challenge was design as Iâ€™m not SO great at it.

***************************************

During this project, I have learned to use React Router
And window.location with new URL() to read id of the meals, so my fullMeal Component knows what to fetch by reading the url.

***************************************

Project lacks a lot of designing by my opinion, if designer
Wishes to collaborate to further this project, You will have my thanks and I will be happy to share credit. Also, if anyone feels like sharing opinion or has any question regarding this project, feel free to contact me.

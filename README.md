Name of the project: 
BE-A-FOODIE - BEST FOOD RECIPES 

Today's project is Recipe Website App.
This project is built using ReactJS framework

Description:
Website App that shows the recipes, upon clicking
on the one you like, you will be routed to a component
that will show the desired meal, it will present you with 
needed ingredients and instructions of how to prepare that meal.


***************************************

I'm learning ReactJS for some time now I have
chosen to build a Recipe App using API.
Special thanks to MealDB (https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)
for this API!

***************************************

While I was coding this project I stumbled upon
many challenges, but since it is a simple project
I had no special problems worth mentioning, API
works great and I never had problems fetching it.
I only wish I had more information on recipes to show.
The biggest challenge was design as Iâ€™m not SO great at it.

***************************************

During this project, I learned to use REACT ROUTER.
/* React Router has amazing documentation! */
And "window.location" with "new URL()" to read id of the meals, 
so my "fullMeal" Component knows what to fetch by reading the url.

***************************************

Project lacks a lot of designing by my opinion, if designer
Wishes to collaborate to further this project, 
You will have my thanks and I will be happy to share credit. 
Also, if anyone feels like sharing opinion or has any question 
regarding this project, feel free to contact me.
